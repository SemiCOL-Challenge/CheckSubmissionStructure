# Check Submission Structure

To install, run (Python >3.6 required):

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

To use the tool, pass the path to any number of ZIP-files as argument. For instance:

```python check.py my_submission.zip```

Note: since we're also checking the content of all segmentation files, this tool may take 2-3 minutes to complete.
